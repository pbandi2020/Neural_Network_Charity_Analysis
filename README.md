# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
##  Overview

The purpose of this project is to use deep-learning neural networks with the TensorFlow platform in Python and classify the success of charitable donations.
We use the following methods for the analysis:
•	Preprocessing the data for the neural network model,
•	Compile, Train and Evaluate the model,
•	Finally in deliverable 3 we Optimize the model by adding additional Hidden Layer to attain higher accuracy.
